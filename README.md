**Day 1 – Data Cleaning**
*Task Objective*
Clean the Mall Customer Segmentation Data by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
*Steps I Did*

2. Checked for duplicates → none found.
3. Cleaned column names (made them lowercase and simple).
4. Standardized Gender column → only Male and Female.
5. Checked data types → all correct (numbers for Age, Income, Score; text for Gender).

*Saved the cleaned dataset as Mall_Customers_Cleaned.xlsx.*
